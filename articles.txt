Meanwhile, don’t miss the latest about cyberthreats against water treatment plants and critical infrastructure in general. And much more! Dive into six things that are top of mind for the week ending March 22. Looking for advice on boosting the security of your cloud environment? Check out the U.S. National Security Agency’s new “Top Ten Cloud Security Mitigation Strategies” for improving an organization’s cloud security posture. “As organizations shift their data to the cloud for ease of processing, storing, and sharing, they must take precautions to maintain parity with on-premises security and mitigate additional cloud-specific threats,” reads the NSA document.     Here are the 10 best practices: While organizations have gone ga-ga over artificial intelligence’s potential to revolutionize their operations, it’s no secret that AI systems need lots of computing power to work their magic. This can be a roadblock for organizations otherwise eager to deploy AI and machine learning tools. If your business is grappling with this issue, you might want to check out a new white paper published this week by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation which looks at how cloud native (CN) computing could help facilitate the adoption of AI and ML systems. “While CN technologies readily support certain aspects of AI/ML workloads, challenges and gaps remain, presenting opportunities to innovate and better accommodate,” reads the document titled “Cloud Native Artificial Intelligence.”     The paper provides an overview of AI and ML techniques; explains what CN technologies offer; discusses existing technical challenges in areas such as data preparation, model training and user experience; and looks at ways to overcome these gaps.  “The paper will equip engineers and business personnel with the knowledge to understand the changing Cloud Native Artificial Intelligence (CNAI) ecosystem and its opportunities,” the document reads. For more information about AI’s computing power needs: Highlighting the U.S. government’s concern with the cybersecurity of water and wastewater treatment plants, the White House invited representatives from all 50 states to discuss the issue.  The virtual meeting, held this week, focused on outlining gaps in cyber defenses; fostering collaboration between federal, state and water-plant leaders; and triggering immediate action. “Disabling cyberattacks are striking water and wastewater systems throughout the United States,” reads the meeting-invitation letter sent to all 50 governors by the White House.     Although water treatment plants offer a critical service, they tend to have weak cybersecurity, due to lack of resources and technical knowhow, according to the letter, penned by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan and by Jake Sullivan, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. “In many cases, even basic cybersecurity precautions – such as resetting default passwords or updating software to address known vulnerabilities – are not in place,” Regan and Sullivan wrote. For more information about protecting water and wastewater systems from cyberattacks, check out these Tenable resources: VIDEO Marty Edwards, Tenable Deputy CTO for OT and IoT, testifies during congressional hearing “Securing Operational Technology: A Deep Dive into the Water Sector”  Cybersecurity agencies from the U.S. and other countries want critical infrastructure leaders to take concrete steps to protect their organizations from Volt Typhoon, a hacking group backed by the Chinese government. In the joint fact sheet “PRC State-Sponsored Cyber Activity: Actions for Critical Infrastructure Leaders,” published this week, the agencies urge leaders of critical infrastructure organizations to take specific steps immediately, including: “The authoring agencies urge leaders to recognize cyber risk as a core business risk. This recognition is both necessary for good governance and fundamental to national security,” the fact sheet reads.     The guidance, jointly issued by cyber agencies from the U.S., Australia, Canada, the U.K. and New Zealand, comes about a month after these same agencies published a joint advisory about Volt Typhoon aimed at IT and OT security teams. That joint advisory, titled “PRC State-Sponsored Actors Compromise and Maintain Persistent Access to U.S. Critical Infrastructure,” warned that Volt Typhoon has quietly infiltrated the IT and OT environments of multiple critical infrastructure organizations, and could strike at a moment’s notice. If you’re involved with ensuring your organization uses AI both securely and responsibly, you might find interesting a new blog published this week by the Cloud Security Alliance that delves into how AI security and AI safety intersect and diverge. AI security refers to the protection of AI systems from cyberattacks, while AI safety encompasses issues like ethics and fairness. "While AI safety and AI security have distinct priorities and areas of focus, they are inextricably linked and must be addressed in tandem to create responsible, trustworthy and secure AI systems,” reads the article, titled “AI Safety vs. AI Security: Navigating the Commonality and Differences."  AI security topics addressed include: Among the AI safety issues addressed are: “Effective AI governance and risk management strategies should encompass both domains throughout the entire AI lifecycle, from design and development to deployment and monitoring,” reads the article.

If your organization is looking for guidance, check out the most recent advice dispensed by McKinsey in its article “Implementing generative AI with speed and safety.” Specifically, the management consulting firm recommends that enterprises take these four steps: For more information about managing generative AI risks: Juan has been writing about IT since the mid-1990s, first as a reporter and editor, and now as a content marketer.

content 2: CISO & VP Labs R&D at LogRhythm.   In the relentless battleground of cybersecurity, threats continue to become more elusive and sophisticated. Among these, threat actors using Living Off the Land (LOTL) techniques have emerged as formidable adversaries, exploiting legitimate system tools and functionalities to compromise networks undetected. As defenders grapple with this stealthy menace, a recent report issued by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) sheds light on the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) employed by attackers and offers crucial insights into identifying and mitigating LOTL techniques. LOTL attacks leverage pre-existing software and legitimate system tools to execute malicious activities, allowing attackers to remain undetected amidst the chaos of network traffic. Rather than developing custom malware or tools, attackers harness the capabilities of built-in utilities like PowerShell, which has been readily available on every Windows operating system since November 2006. The appeal of using existing tools lies in their ubiquity and familiarity within enterprise environments. These tools provide easy access to both local and domain-based configurations, enabling attackers to automate administrative tasks and execute commands with ease. By leveraging these tools, attackers sidestep the arduous process of building, testing and distributing custom tools, thereby saving time and resources. Furthermore, the inherent difficulty in developing and distributing tooling for diverse operating systems and environments poses a significant challenge for attackers. By utilizing existing tools, attackers circumvent the need to address compatibility issues, dependencies and potential detection mechanisms. This approach also reduces the risk of detection, as built-in tools blend seamlessly into legitimate system activities, making it challenging for defenders to differentiate between authorized and malicious usage. In the context of the recent Volt Typhoon report issued by CISA, the relevance of mitigating LOTL techniques cannot be overstated. As cyber attackers continue to refine their tactics and exploit vulnerabilities in organizational defenses, defenders must remain vigilant and proactive. By leveraging the insights provided in the report and adopting a defense-in-depth security approach, organizations can bolster their defenses and mitigate the risks posed by LOTL attacks. Here's how organizations can effectively combat LOTL attacks: Visibility Is Key: Relying solely on preventative technologies is insufficient against threats that use legitimate tools. Visibility into all activities across the entire infrastructure is necessary to identify and mitigate such threats. Identifying Authorized Users: Understand who should be using tools that can be used for LOTL attacks, like scripting languages or administrative tools. Enable Comprehensive Logging: Implement granular logging to track LOTL tool usage. For instance, enabling extended logging for PowerShell scripting provides valuable insight. Leverage Advanced Tools: Consider tools like Microsoft Sysmon for deep visibility into endpoint activity. Centralized Monitoring and Detection: Establish a central platform to collect, analyze and monitor logs for both static and behavioral anomalies. Acceptance of Inherent Risk: Recognize that while 100% security is impossible, proactive measures like log collection, analysis and threat hunting can significantly reduce the risk of attackers remaining undetected long enough to reach their goals. LOTL attacks represent a formidable challenge for cybersecurity professionals, leveraging legitimate tools and system functionalities to evade detection and wreak havoc on targeted systems and networks. By leveraging insights from the Volt Typhoon report and adopting proactive defense measures, organizations can enhance their resilience to LOTL attacks and reduce the risk to their critical assets from malicious actors.

content 4: The U.S. House of Representatives recently passed a bill that would force TikTok’s Chinese owner to either sell the video app or have it banned in the United States. 

Although there is a debate over the details and approach of the law itself, the bill represents growing concerns over just how far the tentacles of Chinese spying reach. 
Indeed, these tentacles are expanding well beyond TikTok through the complex and expanding sea of international economic cooperation, advancing technologies and intelligence gathering methods, intensive military integration with foreign partners, and the role of independent firms with valuable information. As a result, significant risks to U.S. intelligence have been identified in foreign bases where U.S. military technologies are used, at home through critical threats to U.S. infrastructure and technologies, and, most recently, through U.S. contracting firms with links to the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

PRC Military and Infrastructure Expansion
Over the past decade, the U.S. government has become more and more attentive to the threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) extension of its technology and infrastructure across the world, particularly as the PRC has proliferated its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) into states that are security partners with the U.S. At the same time, the Biden administration continues to implement its National Security Strategy of ‘integrated deterrence’ against China and is building deeper security relationships with global partners. Many of these partner states are adopting PRC technologies, military infrastructure, and civilian infrastructure, which the government believes present risks to U.S. intelligence and security. 

The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), for example, has stated that the use of PRC Fifth Generation (5G) technologies by U.S. allies would “create security risks for DOD operations overseas that rely on networks with Chinese components in the supply chain.” Similarly, regarding CCP military equipment, General Michael Erik Kurilla stated in a U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing on USCENTCOM that the CCP’s expanding sales of arms and equipment in the region complicates partnership and cooperation with U.S. forces, noting, ‘...if there is Chinese equipment there, we are not going to be able to integrate it with U.S. equipment.’ PRC military infrastructure projects, such as ports and military bases, also raise red flags for U.S. security cooperation. 
As a result, both the Biden and Trump administrations have attempted to sanction the use of certain PRC technologies and infrastructure by U.S. partners that pose intelligence and security hazards. For example, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency raised concerns about major Chinese investment in Israel, in particular the Haifa port, and eventually led the Israeli navy to take special actions to protect its platforms from spying. In 2021, CIA Director Bill Burns told Prime Minister Naftali Bennett the U.S. was concerned about Chinese investments in Israel, particularly in the tech sector and on major infrastructure projects, and pushed for the creation of an Israeli advisory mechanism to address the national security aspects of foreign investment (the Advisory Committee for National Security Affairs in Foreign Investment). The government has even pressured Britain to divest from Huawei in its 5G networks, in part to protect U.S. personnel and proprietary defense information in future deployments to British bases, and has resisted arms cooperation between U.S. allies and China and Russia.



PRC Hacking and Threats to U.S. Infrastructure
Security and intelligence vulnerabilities are also continuing to emerge at home. In 2023, Microsoft disclosed that a China-based hacking group, which they call “Storm- 0558,” is focused on “gaining access to email systems for intelligence collection” and has breached an unidentified number of email accounts linked to around 25 organizations, including some related to individual consumer accounts and government agencies in Western Europe and the U.S. More recently, U.S. officials and industry security officials told The Washington Post that the Chinese military is ramping up its ability to disrupt key American infrastructure, including power and water utilities as well as communications and transportation systems by burrowing into the computer systems of these entities.

Earlier this year, the U.S. and international cybersecurity authorities issued a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) following the discovery of a cluster of activity of interest associated with a PRC state-sponsored cyber actor, Volt Typhoon. Volt Typhoon, which has traditionally focused on espionage and information gathering, has been developing capabilities that could disrupt critical infrastructure in areas that include communications, manufacturing, utilities, transportation, construction, maritime, government, information technology, and education. According to the Executive Director of the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Brandon Wales: 

It is very clear that Chinese attempts to compromise critical infrastructure are in part to pre-position themselves to be able to disrupt or destroy that critical infrastructure in the event of a conflict, to either prevent the United States from being able to project power into Asia or to cause societal chaos inside the United States–to affect our decision-making around a crisis.




Security Risks from US Contractors in China
U.S. officials are also becoming increasingly unsettled over some of America’s defense contractors’ proximity to China. Earlier this year, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee called for a probe into federal contracts involving private consulting companies that work for both the U.S. government and the Chinese government (and PRC state-run firms) and warned of the potential for major national security risks. In a letter to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Committee cautions:

In some instances, consulting firms have supported entities directly tied to the Chinese government, including by building artificial islands to position missiles, fighters, and bombers in the South China Sea, and participating in exercises for an amphibious assault on Taiwan. We are concerned that the provision of such services simultaneously could create conflicts of interest that threaten American national security and undermine U.S. foreign policy.

Indeed, many U.S. companies that operate in China pay a heavy price in terms of national security. The CCP aggressively monitors foreign firms and forces them to abide by Chinese rules. These firms may also become vulnerable to subversion while in the country. As a result, some experts forewarn that Chinese intelligence officers are stealing their trade secrets and extracting their data. 
The CCP also enacts laws that actively facilitate espionage against foreign companies. China’s National Intelligence Law, for example, declares that “any organization and citizen shall, in accordance with the law, support, provide assistance, and cooperate in national intelligence work, and guard the secrecy of any national intelligence work that they are aware of.” Some analysts interpret this law as requiring Chinese companies to cooperate with intelligence services, including compelling the installation of backdoors to provide private data to the government. Hence, U.S. military consulting firms working with PRC companies may be at risk for exposure. 
Another CCP law requires, among other things, that technology companies that discover or learn of a hackable flaw in their products must share information about it within two days with the PRC’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The Ministry then enters the flaw into the PRC’s Cybersecurity Threat and Vulnerability Information Sharing Platform, or National Vulnerability Database. The data is then shared with several other government bodies, including China’s National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Teams/Coordination Center, or CNCERT/CC, which, in turn, makes the information available to technology "partners" that include Chinese organizations devoted to exploiting these vulnerabilities. 
One such partner, the Beijing bureau of China's Ministry of State Security, has been identified by the White House, the Department of Justice, the United Kingdom, the EU, NATO, and governments from Japan to Norway as being responsible for many of the PRC’s most aggressive state-sponsored hacking operations in recent years and for other spying and cyber-crimes and attacks. CNCERT/CC information is also shared with Shanghai Jiaotong University and the security firm Beijing Topsec, both of which have a history of lending their cooperation to hacking campaigns carried out by China's People’s Liberation Army (PLA).
Despite these security concerns, the federal government–including its key defense agencies–continues to allow its contractors to work closely with the Chinese government. For example, the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security awarded SAP Concur, a cloud-based company that provides travel and expense management software, and its subsidiary, a contract despite the organization having offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. The company also works with several Chinese companies including Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu that, according to China’s National Intelligence Law, are required to support and assist the CCP and the PLA. SAP Concur also stores its China service data in China. 
U.S. Procurement of PRC Equipment
Susceptibilities also occur through the government purchases of foreign equipment. Surprisingly, the U.S. government is still purchasing some Chinese-made drones from DJI, a leading PRC drone manufacturer which has been labeled a Chinese military company in 2022 by the Department of Defense and receives financing from four investment bodies owned or administered by the Chinese government, including one tied to the People’s Liberation Army. Although there has been progress, such as the banning of “foreign-made unmanned aircraft systems” under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, purchases are allowed for civilian federal agencies, such as the U.S. Secret Service and the Department of the Interior, as well as many state and local governments. 
In conclusion, threats to intelligence and security are continually evolve as technology and methods advance and geopolitics change. In recent years, the U.S. Department of Defense has identified many of these new potential intelligence breaches and security vulnerabilities posed by CCP technologies, infrastructure, and firms in foreign countries in which the U.S. maintains security cooperation. However, there is a greater need to address these vulnerabilities at home, many of which are exploited through activities nested in the private sector, U.S. contracting firms, and government institutions. As a result, it is critical that the government adapt information security and cybersecurity to this increasingly intricate environment and apply greater scrutiny and standards to governmental relations with the private sector.

Below are the affected versions and the release that addressed this flaw. Thiago Santana from the ForticlientEMS development team and UK NCSC reported the issue to the company. The initial advisory reported that Fortinet was not aware of attacks in the wild exploiting this vulnerability.  However, the company has updated the advisory confirming that “this vulnerability is exploited in the wild.” Horizon3’s Attack Team published a technical analysis of this vulnerability and the PoC exploit. The researchers demonstrated how to turn this SQL injection issue into remote code execution using the built-in xp_cmdshell functionality of Microsoft SQL Server.  The researchers explained that the database was not configured to run the xp_cmdshell command, however it was possible to do it using a few other SQL statements.  “The POC we are releasing only confirms the vulnerability by using a simple SQL injection without xp_cmdshell. To enable RCE, altering the POC is necessary.” reads the analysis published by Horizon3.  “There are various log files in C:\Program Files (x86)\Fortinet\FortiClientEMS\logs that can be examined for connections from unrecognized clients or other malicious activity. The MS SQL logs can also be examined for evidence of xp_cmdshell being utilized to obtain command execution.” Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi Paganini (SecurityAffairs – hacking, FortiClient)   APT / March 23, 2024 Hacking / March 23, 2024 Hacking / March 23, 2024 Cyber Crime / March 23, 2024 Hacking / March 22, 2024 To contact me write an email to:

China-linked Flax Typhoon APT targets Taiwan Researchers released PoC exploit for Ivanti Sentry flaw CVE-2023-38035 Resecurity identified a zero-day vulnerability in Schneider Electric Accutech Manager Security researchers at Horizon3 have released a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for a critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-48788 (CVSS score 9.3), in Fortinet’s FortiClient Enterprise Management Server (EMS) software. The vulnerability is now actively exploited in attacks in the wild. The vulnerability CVE-2023-48788 is a critical pervasive SQL injection issue that resides in the DAS component. “An improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL Command (‘SQL Injection’) vulnerability [CWE-89] in FortiClientEMS may allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via specifically crafted requests.” reads the advisory. Below are the affected versions and the release that addressed this flaw. Thiago Santana from the ForticlientEMS development team and UK NCSC reported the issue to the company. The initial advisory reported that Fortinet was not aware of attacks in the wild exploiting this vulnerability.  However, the company has updated the advisory confirming that “this vulnerability is exploited in the wild.” Horizon3’s Attack Team published a technical analysis of this vulnerability and the PoC exploit. The researchers demonstrated how to turn this SQL injection issue into remote code execution using the built-in xp_cmdshell functionality of Microsoft SQL Server.  The researchers explained that the database was not configured to run the xp_cmdshell command, however it was possible to do it using a few other SQL statements.  “The POC we are releasing only confirms the vulnerability by using a simple SQL injection without xp_cmdshell. To enable RCE, altering the POC is necessary.” reads the analysis published by Horizon3.  “There are various log files in C:\Program Files (x86)\Fortinet\FortiClientEMS\logs that can be examined for connections from unrecognized clients or other malicious activity. The MS SQL logs can also be examined for evidence of xp_cmdshell being utilized to obtain command execution.” Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi Paganini (SecurityAffairs – hacking, FortiClient)   APT / March 23, 2024 Hacking / March 23, 2024 Hacking / March 23, 2024 Cyber Crime / March 23, 2024 Hacking / March 22, 2024 To contact me write an email to:

content 8: Whether you want to call them “catfishing,” “pig butchering” or just good ‘old-fashioned “social engineering,” romance scams have been around forever.   I was first introduced to them through the MTV show “Catfish,” but recently they seem to be making headlines as the term “pig butchering” enters the public lexicon. John Oliver recently covered it on “Last Week Tonight,” which means everyone my age with an HBO account heard about it a few weeks ago. And one of my favorite podcasts going, “Search Engine,” just covered it in an episode.  The concept of “pig butchering” scams generally follows the same chain of events:  There are a few twists and turns along the way based on the exact scammer, but that’s generally how it works. What I think is important to remember is that this specific method of separating users from their money is not actually new.   The FBI seems to release a renewed warning about romance scams every Valentine’s Day when people are more likely to fall for a stranger online wanting to make a real connection and then eventually asking for money. I even found a podcast from the FBI in 2015 in which they warned that scammers “promise love, romance, to entice their victims online,” estimating that romance-related scams cost consumers $82 million in the last half of 2014.   The main difference that I can tell between “pig butchering” and past romance scams is the sheer scale. Many actors running these operations are relying on human trafficking and sometimes literal imprisonment, forcing these people against their will to send these mass blocks of messages to a variety of targets indiscriminately. Oftentimes in these groups, scammers who are less “successful” in luring victims can be verbally and physically harassed and punished. That is, of course, a horrible human toll that these operations are taking, but they also extend far beyond the world of cybersecurity.  In the case of pig butchering scams, it’s not really anything that can be solved by a cybersecurity solution or sold in a package. Instead, it relies on user education and the involvement of law enforcement agencies and international governments to ensure these farms can’t operate in the shows. The founders who run them are brought to justice.  It’s never a bad thing that users become more educated on these scams, because of that, but I also feel it’s important to remember that romance-related scams, and really any social engineering built on a personal “relationship,” has been around for years, and “pig butchering” is not something new that just started popping up.  These types of scams are ones that our culture has kind of just accepted as part of daily life at this point (who doesn’t get surprised when they get a call about their “car’s extended warranty?), and now the infrastructure to support these scams is taking a larger human toll than ever.  Talos has yet another round of research into the Turla APT, and now we’re able to see the entire kill chain this actor uses, including the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) utilized to steal valuable information from their victims and propagate through their infected enterprises. Before deploying TinyTurla-NG, Turla will attempt to configure anti-virus software exclusions to evade detection of their backdoor. Once exclsions have been set up, TTNG is written to the disk, and persistence is established by creating a malicious service.  Turla, and this recently discovered TinyTurlaNG tool that Talos has been writing about, is an international threat that’s been around for years, so it’s always important for the entire security community to know what they’re up to. Most recently, Turla used these tactics to target Polish non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and steal sensitive data.   During Talos’ research into TinyTurla-NG, we’ve released several new rounds of detection content for Cisco Secure products. Read our past two blog posts on this actor for more.   The Biden administration issued a renewed warning to public water systems and operators this week, saying state-sponsored actors could carry out cyber attacks soon, citing ongoing threats from Iran and China. The White House and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent a letter to every U.S. governor this week warning them that cyber attacks could disrupt access to clean drinking water and “impose significant costs on affected communities.” The letter also points to the U.S. Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency’s list of known exploited vulnerabilities catalog, asking the managers of public water systems to ensure their systems are patched against these vulnerabilities. The EPA pointed to Volt Typhoon, a recently discovered Chinese APT that has reportedly been hiding on critical infrastructure networks for an extended period. A meeting among federal government leaders from the EPA and other related agencies is scheduled for March 21 to discuss threats to public water systems and how they can strengthen their cybersecurity posture. (Bloomberg, The Verge)  UnitedHealth says it's still recovering from a cyber attack that’s halted crucial payments to health care providers across the U.S., but has started releasing some of those funds this week, and expects its payment processing software to be back online soon. The cyber attack, first disclosed in February, targeted Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of United, that handles payment processing and pharmaceutical orders for hospital chains and doctors offices. UnitedHealth’s CEO said in a statement this week that the company has paid $2 billion to affected providers who spent nearly a month unable to obtain those funds or needing to switch to a paper billing system. A recently published survey from the American Hospital Association found that 94 percent of hospitals that responded experienced financial disruptions from the Change Healthcare attack, and costs at one point were hitting $1 million in revenue per day. (ABC News, CNBC)  Nevada’s state court system is currently weighing a case that could undo end-to-end encryption across the U.S. The state’s Attorney General is currently suing Meta, the creators of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, asking the company to remove end-to-end encryption for minors on the platform, with the promise of being able to catch and charge users who abuse the platform to lure minors. However, privacy advocates are concerned that any rulings against Meta and its encryption policies could have larger ripple effects, and embolden others to challenge encryption in other states. Nevada is arguing that Meta’s Messenger a “preferred method” for individuals targeting Nevada children for illicit activities. Privacy experts are in favor of end-to-end encryption because it safeguards messages during transmission and makes it more difficult for other parties to intercept and read them — including law enforcement agencies.

Article 9: CISA, calling Volt Typhoon an urgent threat, updates DDoS response guide

 Photo: diego_cervo/Getty Images Guidance released this week from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and other U.S. and international partners outlines best practices for defending against "living off the land" cyber activity – where threat actors use an organization's own tools to attack its network – while addressing the specific needs and challenges of defending against distributed denial of service attacks with new mitigations and visual aids. WHY IT MATTERS With contributions from Cisco Talos, NTT Corporation and Sophos, the agencies issued a joint fact sheet warning critical infrastructure entities to take the threat of attacks by Chinese state-sponsored actors "seriously." The new guidance follows a Feb. 7 cybersecurity advisory that warned, that due to increased geopolitical tensions, Volt Typhoon has deployed LOTL incursion into critical infrastructure networks to disrupt or destroy critical services. It highlights actions for leaders to take to make informed and proactive resourcing decisions based on the threat. "Key best practices for your cybersecurity teams includes ensuring logging, including for access and security, is turned on for applications and systems and logs are stored in a central system," CISA said, encouraging organizational leaders to ask IT teams to locate and review logs for known commands used by Volt Typhoon's threat actors. The Volt Typhoon commands and PowerShell scripts observed by the U.S. authoring agencies during incident response activities can be found in Appendix A of last month's cybersecurity advisory. "CISA and partners are releasing this fact sheet to provide leaders of critical infrastructure entities with guidance to help prioritize the protection of critical infrastructure and functions," the agency said in the new guidance. "The authoring agencies urge leaders to recognize cyber risk as a core business risk. This recognition is both necessary for good governance and fundamental to national security." In addition, the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center updated the joint for DDoS defense guide, Understanding and Responding to Distributed Denial-Of-Service Attacks, with new technical information on attack vectors, nine visual aids and added mitigations for defending against DDoS techniques. THE LARGER TREND In January, CISA Director Jen Easterly testified before the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party on pre-positioning by the PRC to disrupt critical infrastructure in the United States, including telecommunications. "Chinese cyber actors, including a group known as Volt Typhoon, are burrowing deep into our critical infrastructure to be ready to launch destructive cyberattacks in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the United States," she said in her opening statement. In October, CISA issued a warning that CVE-2023-44487 affecting HTTP/2 – a DDoS exploit also known as Rapid Reset – could compromise critical infrastructure, while the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center alerted its members about the potential for that LOTL threat. While malware may be a more prominent threat to healthcare organizations, a spate of coordinated KillNet DDoS attacks on hospital websites at the turn of 2023 caught the attention of Fitch Ratings, which warned that cyberattacks that compromise service could ultimately affect a hospital’s financial profile. ON THE RECORD "The U.S. authoring agencies assess that the PRC-sponsored advanced persistent threat group known as Volt Typhoon are seeking to pre-position themselves – using [LOTL] techniques – on IT networks for disruptive or destructive cyber activity against U.S. critical infrastructure in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the United States," the agencies said in a statement Tuesday.

Manager Ivanti addressed a critical remote code execution vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-41724 (CVSS score of 9.6), impacting Standalone Sentry solution. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the appliance within the same physical or logical network.  “An unauthenticated threat actor can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the appliance within the same physical or logical network.” reads the advisory. This vulnerability affects all supported versions 9.17.0, 9.18.0, and 9.19.0. Older versions are also impacted. The company urge customers to install the available versions 9.17.1, 9.18.1, and 9.19.1, which address the issue. Vincent Hutsebaut, Pierre Vivegnis, Jerome Nokin, Roberto Suggi Liverani and Antonin B. of the NATO Cyber Security Centre reported the vulnerability. Ivanti is not aware of attacks in the wild exploiting the vulnerability CVE-2023-41724. “We are not aware of any customers being exploited by this vulnerability at the time of disclosure. Threat actors without a valid TLS client certificate enrolled through EPMM cannot directly exploit this issue on the Internet.” reads the advisory. In early February, the Five Eyes intelligence alliance issued a joint cybersecurity advisory warning of threat actors exploiting known vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure gateways. The advisory provides details about the exploitation in the wild of Connect Secure and Policy Secure vulnerabilities CVE-2023-46805, CVE-2024-21887, and CVE-2024-21893. Multiple threat actors are chaining these issues to bypass authentication, craft malicious requests, and execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.

 The US government recently discovered that hackers are now targeting water and sewage tank systems. State governments have already been warned about this. The news came on Tuesday through a joint letter by National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator, Michael Regan, that talked about the impending danger of cyberattacks on crucial public infrastructure. It’s hard to say when these attacks might happen or who will get hit first. It’s believed that the hackers are laying down the attack framework in advance so that if there’s a conflict in the future – political or military – they can quickly strike and weaken the US. Hence, the letter recommends that all state governors run a quick digital assessment of their water and sewage systems and prepare to defend. This is a pressing issue since water systems are a critical part of everyday life. In the past, when government websites were attacked and had to be taken down for weeks, it was hard but still manageable. But having a state’s water facility down for a week will wreak havoc. Investigations have revealed that most of the systems have limited technical capacity and inferior security resources which is evident from the fact that a few water facilities across the country have already been hit in the past. The government has assured that they are trying to amp up security but in the face of this impending danger, it might be best to hurry up.

 The US government recently discovered that hackers are now targeting water and sewage tank systems. State governments have already been warned about this. The news came on Tuesday through a joint letter by National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator, Michael Regan, that talked about the impending danger of cyberattacks on crucial public infrastructure. It’s hard to say when these attacks might happen or who will get hit first. It’s believed that the hackers are laying down the attack framework in advance so that if there’s a conflict in the future – political or military – they can quickly strike and weaken the US. Hence, the letter recommends that all state governors run a quick digital assessment of their water and sewage systems and prepare to defend. This is a pressing issue since water systems are a critical part of everyday life. In the past, when government websites were attacked and had to be taken down for weeks, it was hard but still manageable. But having a state’s water facility down for a week will wreak havoc. Investigations have revealed that most of the systems have limited technical capacity and inferior security resources which is evident from the fact that a few water facilities across the country have already been hit in the past. The government has assured that they are trying to amp up security but in the face of this impending danger, it might be best to hurry up.

content 14: The U.S. government is warning state governors that foreign hackers are carrying out disruptive cyberattacks against water and sewage systems throughout the country. In a letter released Tuesday, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan warned that “disabling cyberattacks are striking water and wastewater systems throughout the United States.” The letter singled out alleged Iranian and Chinese cyber saboteurs. Sullivan and Regan cited a recent case in which hackers accused of acting in concert with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had disabled a controller at a water facility in Pennsylvania. They also called out a Chinese hacking group dubbed “Volt Typhoon” which they said had “compromised information technology of multiple critical infrastructure systems, including drinking water, in the United States and its territories.” “These attacks have the potential to disrupt the critical lifeline of clean and safe drinking water, as well as impose significant costs on affected communities,” the letter said. China’s Embassy in Washington and Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Both countries have in the past denied carrying out cyberattacks The digital safety of water and sewage plants has long been a concern for cybersecurity professionals because the facilities provide a critical service and can often be lightly defended. Last year’s intrusion at a booster facility – which monitors and regulates water pressure – in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania drew particular attention in part because the stricken controller was replaced with a message saying: “YOU HAVE BEEN HACKED.” No damage to the water system was reported, but, in a statement released at the time, an industry group called the Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center said “this may not be an isolated incident.” Tuesday’s letter called on governors to “ensure that all water systems in your state comprehensively assess their current cybersecurity practices” and prepare for potential cyber incidents.

content 15: 'State Armor' founder & CEO Michael Lucci joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how Chinese hackers are targeting American infrastructure and what can be done to mitigate the threat.  The Biden administration warned state leaders that cyberattacks from hackers linked to Iran and China could take down water systems across the U.S. if cybersecurity measures are not taken out of precaution. In a letter to state governors, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Michael S. Regan and Jake Sullivan, the assistant to the President for national security affairs, said cyberattacks are targeting water and wastewater systems throughout the U.S. "These attacks have the potential to disrupt the critical lifeline of clean and safe drinking water, as well as impose significant costs on affected communities," the two wrote. "We are writing to describe the nature of these threats and request your partnership on important actions to secure water systems against the increasing risks from and consequences of these attacks." The letter highlighted two recent and ongoing threats posing a risk to water systems in the U.S. FORMER GOOGLE ENGINEER INDICTED FOR STEALING AI SECRETS TO AID CHINESE FIRMS Cybersecurity logo over a hand (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson) One threat involved hackers linked to the Iranian government's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which have carried out attacks on drinking water systems and other critical elements of infrastructure. Regan and Sullivan said the IRGC cyberattacks went after and disabled technology used at water facilities after the facility neglected to change the default manufacturer password. In the other highlighted threat, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored hacker group, Volt Typhoon, compromised information technology of critical infrastructure systems, including drinking water facilities, in the U.S. and its territories. HOUSE UNANIMOUSLY VOTES TO KEEP SENSITIVE AMERICAN DATA OUT OF HOSTILE COUNTRIES' HANDS The Biden administration warned state governors of two threats targeting U.S. drinking water and wastewater systems. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) (AP Photo/Steve Helber) "Volt Typhoon’s choice of targets and pattern of behavior are not consistent with traditional cyber espionage," the letter read. "Federal departments and agencies assess with high confidence that Volt Typhoon actors are pre-positioning themselves to disrupt critical infrastructure operations in the event of geopolitical tensions and/or military conflicts." The letter also noted that drinking water and wastewater facilities are "attractive" targets for hackers because they often lack the resources and technical capacity to adapt to the latest cybersecurity practices. The EPA is currently the lead agency that addresses and ensures the country’s water is safe from threats and hazards. LEADERS IN NUCLEAR FUSION MEET IN DC TO RAISE MONEY IN RACE AGAINST CHINA White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan speaks during a press briefing at the White House in Washington, Monday, March 18, 2024.  (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Now the agency is asking for state, local, tribal and territorial governments to do their part in ensuring the water sources are safe from cyberattacks. Something as simple as resetting default passwords or updating software to address known vulnerabilities could be taken to fend off these types of attacks, according to the letter. The EPA also plans to engage the Water Sector and Water Government Coordinating Councils to establish the Water Sector Cybersecurity Task Force. The task force will be formed to identify significant vulnerabilities of water systems to cyberattacks as well as the challenges these systems face when it comes to adopting cybersecurity best practices. "We will invite your Environmental, Health and Homeland Security Secretaries to participate with us in a convening to discuss the improvements needed to safeguard water sector critical infrastructure against cyber threats," the letter read. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sullivan and Regan also plan to hold a virtual meeting with state leaders on Thursday to discuss the need to safeguard the critical water sector against cyberattacks. "Drinking water and wastewater systems are a lifeline for communities, but many systems have not adopted important cybersecurity practices to thwart potential cyberattacks," Regan said. "EPA and NSC take these threats very seriously and will continue to partner with state environmental, health, and homeland security leaders to address the pervasive and challenging risk of cyberattacks on water systems."

content 19: The US government is warning state governors that foreign hackers are carrying out disruptive cyber attacks against water and sewage systems throughout the country. In a letter, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan warned that "disabling cyber attacks are striking water and wastewater systems throughout the United States." The letter singled out alleged Iranian and Chinese cyber saboteurs. Sullivan and Regan cited a recent case in which hackers accused of acting in concert with Iran's Revolutionary Guards had disabled a controller at a water facility in Pennsylvania. They also called out a Chinese hacking group dubbed "Volt Typhoon" which they said had "compromised information technology of multiple critical infrastructure systems, including drinking water, in the United States and its territories." "These attacks have the potential to disrupt the critical lifeline of clean and safe drinking water, as well as impose significant costs on affected communities," the letter said.

content 20: The US government is warning state governors that foreign hackers are carrying out disruptive cyber attacks against water and sewage systems throughout the country. In a letter, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan warned that "disabling cyber attacks are striking water and wastewater systems throughout the United States." The letter singled out alleged Iranian and Chinese cyber saboteurs. Sullivan and Regan cited a recent case in which hackers accused of acting in concert with Iran's Revolutionary Guards had disabled a controller at a water facility in Pennsylvania. They also called out a Chinese hacking group dubbed "Volt Typhoon" which they said had "compromised information technology of multiple critical infrastructure systems, including drinking water, in the United States and its territories." "These attacks have the potential to disrupt the critical lifeline of clean and safe drinking water, as well as impose significant costs on affected communities," the letter said.

content 22: Iran and China are positioning themselves to make geopolitical tensions worse The US government has issued a warning to its allies that state-backed hackers from Iran and China are increasingly targeting critical infrastructure, with the most notable attacks against water systems. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) probed a number of Iranian attacks targeting Unitronic programmable logic controllers (PLC) used in water facilities. China has also turned its attention to probing critical US infrastructure in what government officials claim could be practice for a wider playbook in the event of war between the US and China. A public letter issued by Environment Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator, Michael Regan, and National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, said, “Disabling cyberattacks are striking water and wastewater systems throughout the United States. These attacks have the potential to disrupt the critical lifeline of clean and safe drinking water, as well as impose significant costs on affected communities.” While the attack conducted by an Iranian-backed group did not affect the water supply at the targeted facility, a breach of the PLCs used to control the supply of water means that had the attack progressed further, the attackers could have contaminated the water, damaged the facility itself, or even turned off the municipal water supply. Volt Typhoon is the most likely culprit behind the attacks carried out by China, with water facilities alongside power grids, port infrastructure, and at least one oil and gas pipeline. The letter continued, stating, “Federal departments and agencies assess with high confidence that Volt Typhoon actors are pre-positioning themselves to disrupt critical infrastructure operations in the event of geopolitical tensions and/or military conflicts.” Water facilities in the US have long been an easy target for cyber attacks due to the critical underfunding, low staffing levels, and a general lack of cyber security.

content 23: The country's water systems are being hit with an increasing number of nation-state cyberattacks, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is urging US states to dramatically up their IT security measures to guard against future infrastructure attacks. EPA Administrator Michael Regan and Jake Sullivan, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, wrote a letter this week detailing China- and Iran-backed cyberattacks against US water systems. "Disabling cyberattacks are striking water and wastewater systems throughout the United States," Regan and Sullivan write. "These attacks have the potential to disrupt the critical lifeline of clean and safe drinking water, as well as impose significant costs on affected communities." The duo allege that malicious actors connected to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have attacked US water systems, in one case succeeding because the water facility didn't change the default manufacturer password. The Chinese Communist government-backed cyber group Volt Typhoon has also infiltrated multiple "critical infrastructure systems," including those that handle tap water, the letter says. "Volt Typhoon actors are pre-positioning themselves to disrupt critical infrastructure operations in the event of geopolitical tensions and/or military conflicts," Regan and Sullivan write. The EPA and US National Security Council (NSC) will host a meeting Thursday to discuss the issue, potential solutions, and urge state governments to take proactive action, according to a statement. The EPA is also creating a Water Sector Cybersecurity Task Force. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) previously noted in November that some US water systems have been attacked. CISA advised water management facilities to change their default passwords, require multifactor authentication (MFA), and disconnect their programmable logic controllers (PLCs) from the internet or add a firewall or VPN to better secure their systems, to name a few of its suggestions.

content 25: Freelance Journalist The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a stark warning yesterday to leaders of critical infrastructure organizations regarding the imminent threat posed by People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber actors known as “Volt Typhoon.” In collaboration with the National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and other US government and international partners, CISA released a significant advisory on February 7 2024.  The advisory confirmed that Volt Typhoon has been actively infiltrating networks of US critical infrastructure organizations. This infiltration is seen as a strategic move to potentially disrupt or destroy critical services in the event of escalating geopolitical tensions or military conflicts involving the United States and its allies. According to the advisory, Volt Typhoon has successfully compromised organizations across various sectors, including communications, energy, transportation systems and water and wastewater systems. Read more on this threat: US Thwarts Volt Typhoon Cyber-Espionage Campaign Through Router Disruption This infiltration represents a significant business risk not only for organizations in the United States but also for allied countries. In response to this imminent threat, CISA, along with its partners, released a fact sheet on Tuesday aimed at providing executive leaders of critical infrastructure entities with guidance on prioritizing the protection of critical infrastructure and functions. The fact sheet emphasizes the importance of recognizing cyber-risk as a core business risk, essential for both good governance and national security. It urges leaders to empower cybersecurity teams to make informed resourcing decisions and to implement proactive measures to detect and defend against Volt Typhoon and other malicious cyber activities.  Additionally, leaders are encouraged to secure their supply chains, drive a cybersecurity culture within their organizations and ensure robust incident response plans are in place. “All employees need more training and yet most companies only do cybersecurity training once a year,” commented Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4. “It is this fundamental gap between how we are so often successfully attacked and the resources (i.e. training) used to prevent the attack that allows hackers and their malware programs to be so successful for so long.”

content 26: Facepalm: It's been the subject of fearmongering for years – decades, even: elite hackers from hostile foreign nations targeting public utilities on US soil in a bid to bring modern society to its knees (or at the very least, make daily life a bit more stressful). According to a recent letter from the White House, the nightmare scenario may be coming to fruition.  EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan warned of cyberattacks striking drinking water and wastewater systems across the US. The duo highlighted an ongoing attack from actors affiliated with the Iranian Government Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that targets facilities that have neglected to change a default manufacturer password on certain operational technology used. A separate attack involves Volt Typhoon, a state sponsored cyber group associated with the People's Republic of China. According to the warning, Volt Typhoon has successfully compromised multiple critical infrastructure systems in a manner that is not consistent with traditional cyber espionage. Agents believe the group is actively pre-positioning themselves to disrupt infrastructure operations in the event of military conflict or geopolitical tensions.  The White House said water systems are an attractive target for hackers in part because local facilities often lack the resources and technical knowhow required to implement stringent cybersecurity measures. In the face of continued threats, it is imperative that state leaders ensure that all water system operators assess their current cybersecurity practices to identify any significant vulnerabilities, remedy obvious shortcomings, and exercise plans to prepare for, respond to, and recover from a cyberattack. The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) has published a list of actions that water system operators can take to improve their defenses against such attacks. Suggestions include changing default passwords right away, reducing exposure to the public-facing Internet, and conducting cybersecurity awareness training. Operators are also advised to conduct regular cybersecurity assessments, take inventory of tech assets, and back up all IT systems. Image credit: Nils Huenerfuerst, Jani Brumat

content 29: Getty Images CISA warned of the "urgent risk" posed by Chinese state-sponsored threat actors against critical infrastructure organizations and urged their leaders to take defensive actions. In a fact sheet Tuesday, published jointly with the National Security Agency, the FBI, and other domestic and international government partners, CISA provided an overview of how critical infrastructure leaders can defend against risks posed by the Chinese nation-state threat actor tracked as Volt Typhoon. The fact sheet followed a previous security advisory published on Feb. 7 in which CISA said Volt Typhoon had access to certain U.S. critical infrastructure organizations for five years. This advisory was a follow-up to the late January announcement that the U.S. government disrupted a botnet of small office/home office routers used by the threat actor. Although the government managed to wipe out this botnet of primarily end-of-life Cisco and Netgear routers, Volt Typhoon remains a threat. In the fact sheet, CISA emphasized Volt Typhoon's penchant for living-off-the-land techniques -- using legitimate tools and built-in functions of a system to conduct attacks without using malware. As a result, the cyberagency advised organizations to apply effective detection and hardening best practices such as implementing detailed logging. "Volt Typhoon does not rely on malware to maintain access to networks and conduct their activity," CISA said. "Rather, they use built-in functions of a system. This technique, known as 'living off the land,' enables them to easily evade detection. To protect against living off the land, organizations need a comprehensive and multifaceted approach." In addition, CISA said critical infrastructure leaders should conduct tabletop exercises and develop information security plans. "Leaders should ensure personnel from all business sections, including executive leadership, are involved in development of the plan, sign off on it, and are aware of their roles and responsibilities," the advisory read. "Ensuring comprehensive and tested plans are in place and approved enables cybersecurity teams to make appropriate risk-informed decisions." In a section dedicated to securing an organization's supply chain, the fact sheet advised establishing strong vendor risk management processes "to evaluate and monitor third-party risks." For those involved in procurement, CISA said these leaders should use secure-by-design principles to inform decision-making related to which hardware and software vendors to work with. CISA also said critical infrastructure leaders should foster a strong cybersecurity culture by championing risk assessments and audits, engaging with external security experts, and increasing awareness of social engineering tactics. The agency encouraged "collaboration between IT, OT, cloud, cybersecurity, supply chain, and business units to align security measures with business objectives and risk management strategies." TechTarget Editorial contacted CISA for additional comment, but the agency had not responded at press time. This fact sheet is the latest in a series of alarms sounded by the U.S. government regarding nation-state threats to critical infrastructure. On March 18, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan and Jake Sullivan, White House national security adviser, published an open letter to state governors about cyberattacks striking water and wastewater plants. "Drinking water and wastewater systems are an attractive target for cyberattacks because they are a lifeline critical infrastructure sector but often lack the resources and technical capacity to adopt rigorous cybersecurity practices," the letter read. "As the Sector Risk Management Agency identified in Presidential Policy Directive 21 for water and wastewater systems, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the lead Federal agency for ensuring the nation's water sector is resilient to all threats and hazards." In addition to Volt Typhoon, Regan and Sullivan noted that the Iranian government's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has also carried out cyberattacks against U.S. critical infrastructure. They emphasized the need for support from state governors to help identify weaknesses and improve cybersecurity practices at critical infrastructure organizations to better defend against such threats. "Partnerships with State, local, tribal, and territorial governments are critical for EPA to fulfill this mission," they wrote. "In that spirit of partnership, we ask for your assistance in addressing the pervasive and challenging risk of cyberattacks on drinking water systems."

content 31: By  Jess Weatherbed, a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture. Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. The Biden administration is asking states to bolster security for water and wastewater systems, warning that utilities across the country are being targeted by “disabling cyberattacks.”  In a letter sent to all US governors on Tuesday, the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cited ongoing threats from hackers linked with Iranian and Chinese governments, warning that similar attacks could disrupt access to clean drinking water and “impose significant costs on affected communities.” Environmental, Health, and Homeland Security secretaries have been invited to a meeting on March 21st to discuss safeguarding requirements to protect critical water infrastructure against cyber attacks. The EPA is additionally forming a Water Sector Cybersecurity Task Force to identify vulnerabilities and build on recommendations made during the upcoming meeting. “Drinking water and wastewater systems are an attractive target for cyberattacks because they are a lifeline critical infrastructure sector” “Drinking water and wastewater systems are an attractive target for cyberattacks because they are a lifeline critical infrastructure sector but often lack the resources and technical capacity to adopt rigorous cybersecurity practices,” reads the letter signed by national security advisor Jake Sullivan and EPA administrator Michael Regan. The letter asks states to ensure their designated water systems have been assessed for vulnerabilities, pointing to a list of actions recommended by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) that may help to improve security. “In many cases, even basic cybersecurity precautions – such as resetting default passwords or updating software to address known vulnerabilities – are not in place and can mean the difference between business as usual and a disruptive cyberattack,” the letter warns. Hackers believed to be affiliated with the Iranian government conducted attacks against US water facilities in November that hadn’t changed the default manufacturing password on common operational technology they were using. White House national security official Anne Neuberger said the incident was a call to tighten security around utilities, with the US Treasury sanctioning six Iranian Armed Forces officials responsible for the attacks in February.  The letter also referenced threats posed by Volt Typhoon, a Chinese state-sponsored group that was revealed in February to have compromised information about US drinking water systems.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

content 33: A drop of water drips from a leaky faucet. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and National Security Agency are warning state governments that they need to do more to protect water and wastewater systems from cyberattack. In a letter to state governors, the EPA and NSA ask them to ensure that all water systems in their states carry out comprehensive assessments of their current cybersecurity practices to identify any significant vulnerabilities, take steps to reduce their risks and make sure they have plans to prepare for, respond to and recover from a cyber incident. "Drinking water and wastewater systems are an attractive target for cyberattacks because they are a lifeline critical infrastructure sector, but often lack the resources and technical capacity to adopt rigorous cybersecurity practices," the letter warns. The EPA pointed out that there's plenty of guidance available, from the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the American Water Works Association, the National Rural Water Association and the Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center, as well as the EPA itself. However, the letter warns, "In many cases, even basic cybersecurity precautions—such as resetting default passwords or updating software to address known vulnerabilities—are not in place and can mean the difference between business as usual and a disruptive cyberattack." The EPA says it plans to team up with the water sector to create a Water Sector Cybersecurity Task Force to identify near-term actions and strategies to reduce the risk of water systems nationwide to cyberattacks. "The Biden administration has built our national security approach on the foundational integration of foreign and domestic policy, which means elevating our focus on cross-cutting challenges like cybersecurity," said National Security Advisory Jake Sullivan. "We’ve worked across government to implement significant cybersecurity standards in our nation’s critical infrastructure, including in the water sector, as we remain vigilant to the risks and costs of cyber threats." Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure—including water companies—have rocketed in the last few years, with many apparently carried out by groups affiliated with hostile nation states. In one example, attackers linked to the Iranian Government Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps carried out malicious cyberattacks against a number of critical infrastructure organizations, including drinking water systems. They were able to do this by targeting and disabling Unitronics Programmable Logic Controllers, a widely used piece of operational technology, because the facility had failed to change a default manufacturer password. In another example, a Chinese government-sponsored cyber group known as Volt Typhoon was able to compromise multiple critical infrastructure systems, including drinking water. "The current attacks targeting water and wastewater systems should serve as a stark reminder that our critical infrastructure is made up of cyber-physical systems that can be targeted and exploited by hackers," commented Debrup Ghosh, senior manager at the Synopsys Software Integrity Group. "This drives home the point that organisations of all types, including public utilities, are essentially software companies—and as such, they need to take cybersecurity hygiene and software supply chain security seriously."

Article 36: White House Convenes States to Discuss Water Sector Breaches

content 36: UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity Magazine The White House and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have written to state governors asking for their urgent help to boost the cyber-resilience of the water sector, in the fact of escalating attacks. EPA administrator Michael Regan and national security advisor Jake Sullivan invited state environmental, health and homeland security secretaries to a virtual meeting tomorrow to discuss the matter. The duo believe there’s an urgent need to fill gaps in current federal and state efforts to promote cybersecurity best practice in the sector, citing recent incursions by Chinese and Iranian threat actors. In December 2023, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) revealed Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was behind a series of strikes against water plants. They were able to compromise default credentials on Unitronics programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to display anti-Israel messages. Arguably more serious were revelations two months later that a Chinese threat group known as Volt Typhoon had pre-positioned itself in various critical national infrastructure (CNI) networks including the water and wastewater sector. The US agencies that penned the alert claimed that the end goal could have been to launch destructive attacks against US CNI in the event of a military conflict. The group used a large botnet of compromised small office/home office (SOHO) routers to carry out attacks on CNI networks, and once inside used living-off-the-land techniques to stay hidden, they claimed. Read more on Volt Typhoon: US Thwarts Volt Typhoon Cyber-Espionage Campaign Through Router Disruption “We need your support to ensure that all water systems in your state comprehensively assess their current cybersecurity practices to identify any significant vulnerabilities, deploy practices and controls to reduce cybersecurity risks where needed, and exercise plans to prepare for, respond to, and recover from a cyber incident,” the letter to state governors read. “In many cases, even basic cybersecurity precautions – such as resetting default passwords or updating software to address known vulnerabilities – are not in place and can mean the difference between business as usual and a disruptive cyber-attack.” The letter noted that water and wastewater companies have a wealth of resources they can draw on to help them in these efforts. These include “guidance, tools, training, resources and technical assistance” from CISA and the EPA, and private sector bodies like the American Water Works Association, the National Rural Water Association, and the Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center. “Additionally, EPA will engage the Water Sector and Water Government Coordinating Councils to form a Water Sector Cybersecurity Task Force, which will build on recommendations from your environmental, health and homeland security secretaries,” the letter concluded. “The Task Force will identify the most significant vulnerabilities of water systems to cyber-attacks, the challenges that water systems face in adopting cybersecurity best practices, and near-term actions and long-term strategies to reduce the risk of water systems nationwide to cyber-attacks.”

Manager The Pokemon Company announced it had reset the passwords for some accounts after it had detected hacking attempts, Techcrunch first reported. The company was likely the target of credential stuffing attacks. Credential stuffing is an attack in which hackers use automation and lists of compromised usernames and passwords to defeat authentication and authorization mechanisms, with the end goal of account takeover (ATO) and/or data exfiltration.  In other words, bad actors glean lists of breached usernames and passwords and run them against desired logins until they find some that work. Then, they enter those accounts for the purpose of abusing permissions, siphoning out data, or both.  Last week, the Pokemon’s official support website displayed the following message:  “Following an attempt to compromise our account system, Pokémon proactively locked the accounts offans who might have been affected. If you are unable to log in to your Pokémon Trainer Club account,please reset your password following the instructions here.” Pokémon, short for “Pocket Monsters,” is a media franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori and managed by The Pokémon Company, a collaboration between Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures Inc. It was first introduced in 1996 as a video game for the original Game Boy console, developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo. The franchise expanded to include video games, trading card games, animated television series, movies, comic books, toys, and merchandise. In Pokémon, players assume the role of Pokémon Trainers who capture and train fictional creatures called Pokémon to battle each other for sport. Daniel Benkwitt, a Pokemon Company spokesperson, told Techcrunch that they haven’t suffered a security breach. Most of the hacking attempts against some users were detected and blocked, and only 0.1% of the the targeted accounts were compromised. “The account system was not compromised. What we did experience and catch was an attempt to log in to some accounts. To protect our customers we have reset some passwords which prompted the message,” said Benkwitt. A good mitigation against credential-stuffing attacks, and generally against account hijacking, is enabling multi-factor authentication.  Unfortunately, the Pokemon Company doesn’t support two-factor authentication on its platform.

 The Biden administration on Tuesday warned the nation’s governors that drinking water and wastewater utilities in their states are facing “disabling cyberattacks” by hostile foreign nations that are targeting mission-critical plant operations. “Disabling cyberattacks are striking water and wastewater systems throughout the United States,” Jake Sullivan, assistant to the president for National Security Affairs, and Michael S. Regan, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, wrote in a letter. “These attacks have the potential to disrupt the critical lifeline of clean and safe drinking water, as well as impose significant costs on affected communities.” The letter cited two recent hacking threats water utilities have faced from groups backed by hostile foreign countries. One incident occurred when hackers backed by the government of Iran disabled operations gear used in water facilities that still used a publicly known default administrator password. The letter didn’t identify the facility by name, but details included in a linked advisory tied the hack to one that struck the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa in western Pennsylvania last November. In that case, the hackers compromised a programmable logic controller made by Unitronics and made the device screen display an anti-Israel message. Utility officials responded by temporarily shutting down a pump that provided drinking water to local townships. The second threat was publicly revealed last month by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Officials said that a hacking group backed by the Chinese government and tracked under the name Volt Typhoon was maintaining a foothold inside the networks of multiple critical infrastructure organizations, including those in communications, energy, transportation, and water and wastewater sectors. The advisory said that the hackers were pre-positioning themselves inside IT environments to enable disruption operations across multiple critical infrastructure sectors in the event of a crisis or conflict with the US. The hackers, the officials said, had been present in some of the networks for as long as five years. “Drinking water and wastewater systems are an attractive target for cyberattacks because they are a lifeline critical infrastructure sector but often lack the resources and technical capacity to adopt rigorous cybersecurity practices,” Sullivan and Regan wrote in Tuesday’s letter. They went on to urge all water facilities to follow basic security measures such as resetting default passwords and keeping software updated. They linked to this list of additional actions, published by CISA and guidance and tools jointly provided by CISA and the EPA. They went on to provide a list of cybersecurity resources available from private sector companies. The letter extended an invitation for secretaries of each state's governor to attend a meeting to discuss better securing the water sector's critical infrastructure. It also announced that the EPA is forming a Water Sector Cybersecurity Task Force to identify vulnerabilities in water systems. The virtual meeting will take place on Thursday. “EPA and NSC take these threats very seriously and will continue to partner with state environmental, health, and homeland security leaders to address the pervasive and challenging risk of cyberattacks on water systems,” Regan said in a separate statement.

 The Environmental Protection Agency and National Security Council are urging states to stay alert for cyber threats targeting water sector infrastructure, according to a letter made public on Tuesday. The missive from EPA Administrator Michael Regan and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is addressed to state governors and warns that hackers linked to China and the IRGC still pose a threat to water sector systems that clean and distribute water to communities. “Drinking water and wastewater systems are an attractive target for cyberattacks because they are a lifeline critical infrastructure sector but often lack the resources and technical capacity to adopt rigorous cybersecurity practices,” it says, encouraging state governments to “comprehensively assess their current cybersecurity practices to identify any significant vulnerabilities” and implement other safeguards to stop hackers. The Treasury Department sanctioned Iranian cyber operatives in early February for supporting a Tehran-backed hacking group’s infiltration into multiple states’ programmable logic controllers used for water treatment late last year, prompting mitigation advisories from officials. The letter also calls out Volt Typhoon, a hacking group linked to the Chinese government that has been surreptitiously digging into U.S. critical infrastructure. A top NSA official said Friday that the U.S. is still identifying victims targeted by the group. The Biden administration has been pushing to shore up protections for water treatment facilities against cyber threats, which researchers say are highly exposed to hacking attempts. But the EPA in October rescinded a memorandum that would have directed providers to evaluate cyber defenses of their water systems when conducting sanitation surveys, after facing legal pushback from GOP-led states and trade groups. A group of water trade group representatives testified before a House panel earlier this year, urging Congress to take up measures that would give water facilities more federal funding for training and other resources they say are needed to defend their infrastructure. The letter says the administration will invite states’ Environmental, Health and Homeland Security secretaries to partake in discussions around safeguarding the U.S. water sector. It also encourages them to engage with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on developing defenses.
